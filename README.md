This is a dataset for Ford GoBike Service for Feb - 2019 , It consists of 170 K information about the

Ford GoBike is the Bay Area’s bike share system. Bay Area Bike Share was introduced in 2013. It 
services San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose. Similar to other bike share systems, Ford GoBike 
consists of a fleet of bikes that can be unlocked in one station and returned in any other network
